# Planck_plus
55
This is a project to build a 55% keyboard from scratch. It will utilize PicoMK, however unlike most PicoMK projects this board will not use The RPI Pico or RPI Pico W in its first iteration. Instead this board will integrate a RP2040 with all the ancillary equipment. 
The layout of the board is much like a Plank keyboard however it includes the numeric part of “alpha-numeric keys” so it has an extra row of keys dedicated to Arabic numerals. The first row of the keyboard has also been altered from a standard Planck; This keyboard has sacrificed 2 1u keys in favor of homogenizing all bottom row modifier keys to 1.5u. It also increases the size of the two spacebars to 2u each, this is a muscle memory concern comparing the proportion of a standard Planck to a standard keyboard. The keys at the West and South of the board have also been homogenized to 1.5u.  This keyboard will also be using Kailh PG1350 Choc mechanical switches instead of MX type switches as this project is intended to be used with mobile computing systems or SBC’s.

58 keys total:
1u = 46
1.5u = 10
2u = 2
Kailh PG1350 type Jade Mechanical Switches: Chosen for initial build as the Jades are my favorite MX type switch currently available (from cursory glance it cant for ascertained whether or not these low profile switches have a click bar like their MX cousins).

Keycaps: TBD

Connection: USB-A 1.1 (I have plenty of USB-A cables that would like a use, more than enough bandwidth for keyboard)
	-No wireless capability for the time being although Bluetooth would be a nice addition if a need is found.
